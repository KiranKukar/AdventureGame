This project will be to help be practice and embed the languages and programming practices I am learning at Makers Academy. I will aim to keep it feeling like a cohesive project with clear user stories but I will make adjustments if needed for the sake of practice.

The Adventure Game will be a web app, run locally off a machine (for now) that player's can use to go on an adventure. I will begin with single player functionality and work up to multiple players.
